## 21st May: Heineken Party Night

From 4pm. Come along and have a good night. Your first Heineken 360ml is on our Sponsor, after that every Heineken purchased puts you into the draw. First draw is at 5.30, next at 6.00, and grand prize 6.30pm - but you must be there to claim your prize when drawn.

The Jackets will be ordered to your size and delivered to the club in the next week. Click on this link to see the prizes:[Party poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVtEoPm_u0Fv98a81O8Fh-4AchrTwBTg/view?usp=sharing)

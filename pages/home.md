# Welcome

With the best views of the Haven, **Nelson** City Club is an easy-going, safe place where both young and old can enjoy a beer (fully licensed bar), have a meal (onsite kitchen), and play a game of pool, darts or snooker. The venue can also be hired.

> "We have good parking available, a lovely lounge with a great outlook, a darts section, pool tables and a big snooker room."
<small>*~ Peter Fisher*</small>. 

A charter club since 1890, City Club has had a long local history; initially operating as a business network club in the central city, its new location at **1 Kinzett Terrace, Nelson** [[Google Maps link](https://goo.gl/maps/pUmQtzwUdbDowJ1V9)] is also proving popular, with any previous members welcome back at a special rate. 

City Club has joint membership with the **Maitai Bowling Club**. Our annual membership fee is only **$40 per person**, with junior membership also available. If you are considering joining, come down to the club and see how you feel about it.

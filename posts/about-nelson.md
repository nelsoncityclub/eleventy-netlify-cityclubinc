## Brief Description

> **Nelson** ([Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language "Māori language"): *Whakatū*) is a city on the eastern shores of [Tasman Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Bay "Tasman Bay"). Nelson is the oldest city in the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island "South Island") and the second-oldest settled city in New Zealand – it was established in 1841 and was proclaimed a city by royal charter in 1858.

> Nelson City is bordered to the west and south-west by Tasman District Council and to the north-east, east and south-east by Marlborough District Council. The city does not include Richmond, the area's second-largest settlement. Nelson City has a population of around 50,000, making it New Zealand's [12th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_New_Zealand#City_councils "List of cities in New Zealand") most populous city. When combined with the town of [Richmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_New_Zealand "Richmond, New Zealand"), which has roughly 15,000 residents, the whole conurbation is ranked as New Zealand's [9th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_list_of_New_Zealand_urban_areas "Ranked list of New Zealand urban areas") largest urban area by population.
